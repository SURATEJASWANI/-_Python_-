1.	Create a set with elements from 1 to 5. Add elements 6 and 7 to the set in one line.

2.	Given two sets:
           A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
           B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Find elements that are present in A or B but not both (symmetric difference).

3.	Remove an element from a set, but avoid error if element doesn't exist.
 Find maximum and minimum element from a set {5, 8, 12, 3, 15, 7}.

4.	Create a set with the values: 10, 20, 30, 40. Then add the value 50 to the set.

5.	Remove an element 30 from a set {10, 20, 30, 40, 50} using a set method.

6.	Check whether the number 25 exists in the set {15, 20, 25, 30, 35}.

7.	Find the union of two sets:
           A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
           B = {3, 4, 5, 6}

8.	Find the intersection of two sets:
           A = {10, 20, 30, 40}
            B = {30, 40, 50, 60}
